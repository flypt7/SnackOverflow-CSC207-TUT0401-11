# SnackOverflow ~ _Your next best dish_

We are the **SnackOverflow Team**. Our goal? Make you find your next meal in an intuitive app.

---
## What for?

- _Have **specific ingredients left** and wondering how to use them?_

☑ You can look up recipes by ingredient and adjust to
any portion size you want!

- _What if you're **in a rush**, or looking for recipes from a **certain country or region**?_

☑ We got you covered! SnackOverflow offers a plethora of **filter options** to match your needs at any given time.

- _Love the recipe you're looking at, but wonder if there's any similar ones?_

☑ SnackOverflow has a built-in similarity algorithm to determine the dishes that are most similar to the recipe on your 
screen!

- _Well, this is great and all, but it's not very useful if you can't **save recipes** anywhere..._

☑ We thought about that too! SnackOverflow provides an **account system**, with which you can add recipes to your 
"dishlist" to keep them for later!

## User Stories

1) As a user, I sometimes have trouble coming up with recipes with the  ingredient that I already have.


2) As a user, I want to filter by recipe requirements like cooking time, type of cuisine, etc.


3) As a user, I want to save my recipes by having my own account and a login/log out feature


4) As a user, I want to view related or similar recipes after opening one, so I can explore alternatives.


5) As a user, I want to tag recipes with keywords (e.g., “quick,” “budget,” “holiday”) so I can filter by mood or occasion.


6) As a user, I want to adjust serving sizes and have ingredient quantities automatically update.

## [User Story] Time-permitting Ideas

These are here in case we have enough time before the deadline to polish the project and add more things to it.

- [4] Adding a "preference" system for weighted similarities
- [6] Adding a print (to PDF) mechanism for recipes
- [6] Let the user add notes/ratings to recipes
- [2] add more filters (can do so for almost all data given in API requests)
